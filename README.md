# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 

The project main focus is to perform a risk analysis for loan repayments on credit card client by using diferent models such as Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Undersampling, Combination (Over and Under) Sampling, Ensemble Learners,Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier,  .

## Results: 

#### Naive Random Oversampling
    The balanced accuracy score is 0.6503524738582371
    High_risk rec 69%
    Low_risk rec 61%

## Summary: 
    The model that have the best acuracy is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier, 
    this would be the one i would recomend for the credit analysis risk.
